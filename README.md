## Architecture Decision Records

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is used to capture, document, and communicate important 
architecture decisions during the software development process.

The use of ADRs brings several advantages:
* Transparency and Traceability: By documenting architecture decisions, team members and stakeholders can understand why specific design decisions were made.
* Consistency: ADRs promote consistent architecture documentation throughout the project, which facilitates maintainability and further development.
* Knowledge Sharing: ADRs serve as a means of knowledge exchange within the team, allowing new team members to quickly familiarize themselves with the architecture.
* Decision Review: By documenting decisions, teams can later review, evaluate, and potentially adjust decisions made as requirements or conditions change.

Overall, the use of ADRs promotes a structured and traceable approach to architecture documentation and decision-making, 
contributing to an overall improved software architecture and development process.

### ADR Status
There are several statuses that can be defined in an ADR. 
These provide an overview of how far the decisions have been elaborated.

* Proposed: The decision has been proposed and is still being discussed or evaluated.
* In Progress: The decision is currently in progress and has not been completed yet.
* Accepted: The decision has been accepted and is being implemented.
* Done: The decision has been fully implemented and is actively in use.
* Rejected: The decision has been rejected and will not be implemented.
* Deprecated: The decision was valid but is no longer current or recommended due to new developments or requirements.
* Superseded: The decision has been replaced by a new decision or update in another ADR.
* Withdrawn: The decision has been withdrawn and is no longer valid.
* Revised: The decision has been revised or updated to account for changes or new insights.
* Abandoned: The decision has been abandoned and will no longer be pursued.

### CLI-Tool
For managing ADRs, the "adr-tools" tool is used. 
This makes the creation and management of documents easier.
