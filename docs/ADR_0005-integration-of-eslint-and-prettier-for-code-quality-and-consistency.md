# 5. Integration of ESLint and Prettier for Code Quality and Consistency

Date: 2024-03-25

Deciders: Jens Schreiber

## Status

Status: Accepted (Last Updated: 2024-03-27)

## Context and Problem Statement

To ensure a consistent code structure and improve code quality, the tools ESLint and Prettier are being used. Employing
these tools allows for easy code formatting and analysis within the development process.

## Considered Options

- ESLint
- Prettier

## Decision Outcome

It has been decided to use ESLint and Prettier as integrated tools to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Consistent Code Structure:** The tools ensure a uniform formatting style and code quality.
2. **Automated Code Analysis:** Integration of ESLint and Prettier introduces automated code analysis into the
   development process.
3. **DX Enhancement with JSDoc:** ESLint is extended to enforce the definition of "jsdoc" comments, improving Developer
   Experience (DX) by displaying variations of calls as examples.
4. **Security through Security Plugin:** Inclusion of a security plugin in ESLint helps identify programming errors
   caused by the utilized utility code.
5. **Strict Rules for Code Quality:** Tool configurations are kept strict to ensure that only high-quality and
   meaningful code is incorporated into projects.

### Consequences

- **High Code Quality:** Adhering to defined rules and structures leads to overall higher code quality.
- **Unified Development Practices:** All projects use the same configurations and dependencies, resulting in consistent
  development practices.
- **Transparency in Configuration Changes:** Projects requiring adjustments must create their own configurations
  inheriting from parent (root) configurations, clearly documenting the reasons for the changes.

The integration of these tools and adherence to defined rules are managed through the main project to ensure that each
new package or module adheres to the same quality standards. This contributes to a consistent and reliable development
process.
