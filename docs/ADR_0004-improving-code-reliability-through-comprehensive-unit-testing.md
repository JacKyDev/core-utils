Date: 2024-03-23

Deciders: Jens Schreiber
Technical Story: https://github.com/JacKyDev/utils/issues/11

## Status

Status: Accepted (Last Updated: 2024-03-23)

## Context and Problem Statement

In our development process, ensuring code reliability is crucial for maintaining software quality and reducing bugs in
production. Comprehensive unit testing plays a vital role in achieving this goal by thoroughly testing individual units
of code to validate their correctness.

## Considered Options

* Vitest
* Jest
* Jasmine

## Decision Outcome

After evaluating various unit testing frameworks, we have decided to adopt Vitest as our primary unit testing framework
for the following reasons:

* __Simplicity and Ease of Use:__ Vitest provides a simple and intuitive testing syntax that allows developers to write
  tests
  quickly and efficiently.

* __Comprehensive Testing Capabilities:__ Vitest offers a wide range of testing functionalities, including assertions,
  mocks,
  and test coverage analysis, enabling us to create comprehensive test suites.

* __Community Support and Documentation:__ Vitest benefits from active community support and extensive documentation,
  making
  it easier for team members to onboard and leverage advanced testing features.

* __Integration with Continuous Integration (CI) Pipelines:__ Vitest seamlessly integrates with our existing CI
  pipelines,
  allowing us to automate test execution and receive immediate feedback on code changes.

While the other frameworks considered offer robust testing capabilities, Vitest stood out due to its simplicity,
comprehensive features, and seamless integration with our development workflow and CI processes.

### Consequences

By adopting Vitest as our testing framework, we expect the following positive outcomes:

* __Improved Code Quality:__ Comprehensive unit testing will help identify and fix issues early in the development
  lifecycle,
  leading to higher code quality and fewer bugs in production.

* __Enhanced Developer Productivity:__ Vitest's simplicity and powerful features will streamline the testing process,
  allowing
  developers to write tests more efficiently and focus on writing robust code.

* __Increased Confidence in Code Changes:__ Automated testing with Vitest will provide rapid feedback on code changes,
  giving
  developers confidence to refactor and make modifications without fear of breaking existing functionality.
